How to create new .h sound files:
Audacity:
import the WAV sound file you want in Audacity
convert it to mono, if needed: Tracks > Mix > Mix Stereo down to Mono
on the bottom left, select project frequency 22050Hz or 16000
search for a cyclic pattern in the idle sound (the amount of ignition pulses is usually the same as the cylinder number), cut the "idle" sample to exactly this length, have a close look at the zero crossings to avoid clicking noises. The loudest peak should always be at the end of the sample.
do the same with the "rev" sound. It will be 2 - 4 times shorter than the "idle" sample, depending on the engine and rpm of the "rev" sample
change the "Rate" (dropdown on the left of the sample) of the "rev" sample, until the length is the same as in the "idle" sample. This is very important!
duplicate a part of the "rev" sample (the one with the original, unchanged "Rate" speed). This is the "knock" sample. Cut it to this max length: "Idle" length / number of cylinders / rpm range "MAX_RPM_PERCENTAGE" (usually 2 - 4 or 200 - 400%)
adjust the volume of all samples, so that the entire dynamic range is used
you may also want to apply high pass or low pass filters to fine tune the sound
